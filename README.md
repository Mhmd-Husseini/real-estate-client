<!-- Tech stack -->

###  Lebanon RealEstate Insights is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Javascript Library](https://react.dev/). 
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. It is used to design frontend for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent data storage (database), the website and admin desktop application use [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to create a structured database schema for efficiently storing and retrieving information related to properties, users, and other data.
- This project uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com), a robust PHP web application framework, as a central component of its architecture. Laravel plays a pivotal role in the project, primarily focusing on the development of robust and secure APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). These APIs serve as the vital link connecting the frontend React components with the backend database, which is powered by MySQL.
